Hi, I’m Amneh 👋
I’m a Master’s student in Information Systems Management (TU Berlin) interested in Business Analysis and Data Analytics.

What I work with: Excel (dashboards, pivot tables), SQL (data cleaning, business queries), and I’m starting with Power BI and Python for data analysis.

Projects on this profile:

Excel sales dashboard (interactive filters, KPIs)

Multiple SQL analysis projects (retail sales, pizza sales, Olympics history)

I’m using this space to learn in public and build a portfolio for junior Business Analyst / Data roles.
